# Event Manager Company: Software QA Analyst/Developer Onboarding Assignment

## Issues Fixed

### [Internal Server Error on User Creation](https://github.com/VaishnaviGangam/event_manager/issues/1)

  To fix the problem of the application crashing when trying to create users, I did the following:

  1. **Figured Out the Issue:** I looked into why the app was crashing and found out it was because it couldn't make new users like it should.

  2. **Checked Database Changes:** I made sure the way the app changes the database was correct. I saw that some things about creating users were missing or wrong.

  3. **Fixed Database Changes:** I corrected how the app changes the database. I added the missing things and made sure everything matched what the app needed.

  4. **Adjusted User Roles:** I made sure the roles users can have were updated to match the changes in the database. This helps keep everything working smoothly.

  5. **Tested Everything:** After making the fixes, I tried making new users to make sure it worked without crashing.

  6. **Made Sure It Worked:** Once I confirmed it was fixed, I double-checked that the app made users like it should, without any more crashes.

  7. **Sent Changes for Review:** Lastly, I bundled up all the fixes and asked others to check them before adding them to the app.

  With these steps, I managed to stop the app from crashing when creating users by fixing how it interacts with the database and testing to make sure it works properly.
